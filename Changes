Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Mason.

0.3   Wed Nov 25 17:00:34 PST 1998
        - added optional system logging of page requests, cache
          activity, component loading
	- deny directory requests so that index files will work in
          mod_perl 1.16+
	- removed reliance on several external packages (Date::Manip,
          CGI::Base, URI::Escape). This should reduce the
          amount of memory taken up by Mason processes and make Mason
          easier to install.
	- INCOMPATIBILITY: due to the removal of Date::Manip, the
          mc_date command will no longer work unless Date::Manip is
          explicitly used, and the syntax for the expire_at cache
          parameter and the Interp current_time parameter have changed.
	- added parser taint_check flag which allows Mason to work
          with taint checking on (suggested by Randal Schwartz)
        - added warning messages when returning 404 from ApacheHandler
	- improved cache locking with the use of separate lock files
	- Makefile.PL checks for required and optional packages
	- documentation fixes and improvements
	- removed obsolete and undocumented commands from Commands.pm
        - failure to write debug file is now a warning rather than
          fatal error
        - augmented "no configuration for previewer port" error
        - fixed $interp->exec to be able to return list
        - changed parser to remove ctrl-Ms instead of replacing with
          spaces
        - always call http_header hook, not just at top level
        - added global IN_DEBUG_FILE flag
        - renamed mc_call_stack to mc_comp_stack to match
          documentation

0.2   Fri Aug 21 08:54:13 1998
	- replaced File::lockf module, which could not port to some
          systems, with simple call to flock
	- corrected email address in README
	- fixed undeclared variable bug in preview component
	- the previewer did not work in basic versions of Perl 5.004
          due to an eval scoping bug. A workaround was put in place.
	- fixed expire_if cache option to pass correct argument to
          provided subroutine
	- empty argument section no longer parsing incorrectly
	- took out directory names from manifest which were causing
          errors on install
	- debug file is no longer prepared when debug_mode is "none"
	- use Preview.pm in Mason.pm
